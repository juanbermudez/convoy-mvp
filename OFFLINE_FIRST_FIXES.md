# Offline-First Implementation Fixes

This document outlines the fixes applied to the Convoy MVP application to address issues with the offline-first implementation using WatermelonDB and Supabase.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Schema Mismatch**: The Supabase database schema was missing required columns and tables:
   - Added `deleted_at` columns to all tables for soft deletion
   - Added `last_modified_by` and `client_version` columns for synchronization
   - Added `sync_history` table for tracking synchronization status

2. **UI Component Error**: Fixed a React error in the Select component:
   - Updated SelectItem components to use 'all' instead of empty string values
   - Modified filter logic to handle the new values correctly

3. **Sync Error Handling**: Improved error handling in the sync process:
   - Added schema compatibility checking before attempting sync
   - Added graceful fallbacks for missing columns
   - Enhanced processing of deleted records to handle missing fields

## How to Apply the Fixes

### 1. Update the Database Schema

Run the provided script to apply the schema changes to your Supabase database:

```bash
./apply-schema-update.sh
```

This script will apply the migration contained in `/supabase/migrations/20250416_fix_schema_for_offline.sql`.

### 2. Restart the Application

After applying the database changes, restart the application:

```bash
cd dashboard
pnpm dev
```

The application should now be able to:
- Detect schema compatibility issues gracefully
- Synchronize data between WatermelonDB and Supabase
- Handle all UI components properly

## Testing the Fixes

To verify that the fixes have been applied correctly:

1. Check the schema in Supabase:
   - Verify that the `deleted_at` columns exist in all tables
   - Verify that the `sync_history` table exists

2. Test the application in offline mode:
   - Disconnect from the internet
   - Create/edit some data
   - Reconnect to the internet and verify sync works

3. Check the UI components:
   - Verify that all dropdown filters in the Tasks view work correctly
   - Ensure no React errors appear in the console

## Technical Details

### Schema Migration

The schema migration adds the following to your Supabase database:

1. **Soft Delete Support**:
   - `deleted_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE` column on all tables
   - Indexes for efficient querying of non-deleted records

2. **Sync Support**:
   - `last_modified_by TEXT` column to track the client that made changes
   - `client_version INTEGER` column for conflict resolution
   - `sync_history` table to track synchronization attempts and results

### Error Handling Improvements

The SyncService now includes:

1. **Schema Compatibility Check**:
   - Verifies required tables and columns exist before syncing
   - Provides clear error messages when schema is incompatible

2. **Graceful Fallbacks**:
   - Falls back to simple queries when columns don't exist
   - Handles both online and offline scenarios properly

### Component Fixes

Updated SelectItem components now:
- Use non-empty string values ('all' instead of '')
- Handle value changes correctly in the filter logic
- Properly display the selected values in the UI

## Conclusion

These fixes address the critical issues with the offline-first implementation, making the system more robust and able to handle various edge cases. The application can now gracefully handle schema mismatches and properly synchronize data between the local database and Supabase.
