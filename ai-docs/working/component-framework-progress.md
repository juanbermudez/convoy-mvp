## Progress Summary

This document tracks the progress of implementing Phase 2 of the UI transition plan: developing the core component framework that will provide the foundation for all shadcn/ui components.

### Current Status

Phase 1 (Environment Setup) has been completed successfully. We have now implemented most of Phase 2 components and are ready for testing.

### Completed Tasks

1. **Implement Core Layout**
   - [x] Created `components/layout/BaseLayout.tsx` with responsive structure
   - [x] Created `components/layout/sidebar.tsx` based on shadcn/ui design with collapsible functionality
   - [x] Created `components/layout/ThemeProvider.tsx` for theme management
   - [x] Created `components/layout/ToggleTheme.tsx` for theme switching
   - [x] Created `components/layout/DragWindowRegion.tsx` for Electron window controls
   - [x] Created utility files:
     - `utils/window-helpers.ts` for Electron window operations
     - `utils/theme-helpers.ts` for theme management
     - `types/electron.d.ts` for TypeScript definitions

2. **Set Up Routing**
   - [x] Created `src/renderer/routes/index.ts` - main router configuration
   - [x] Created `src/renderer/routes/root.tsx` - root layout wrapper
   - [x] Created route files for main sections:
     - `routes/dashboard.tsx` - main dashboard view
     - `routes/projects.tsx` - projects listing view
     - `routes/task-list.tsx` - tasks listing view
     - `routes/task-detail.tsx` - individual task view
     - `routes/settings.tsx` - application settings view

3. **Implement Data Management**
   - [x] Created `src/renderer/lib/query-client.ts` - React Query configuration
   - [x] Created `src/renderer/lib/ipc.ts` - IPC communication layer
   - [x] Created `src/renderer/hooks/use-projects.ts` - data fetching and mutations for projects
   - [x] Created `src/renderer/hooks/use-tasks.ts` - data fetching and mutations for tasks
   - [x] Created `src/renderer/hooks/use-activities.ts` - data fetching for activity feed

4. **Create Basic Navigation Components**
   - [x] Created `components/layout/Breadcrumbs.tsx` - navigation breadcrumbs
   - [x] Created `components/layout/PageHeader.tsx` - consistent page headers
   - [x] Updated `index.tsx` to set up the application with routing and data providers
   - [x] Created `mocks.ts` to provide test data for development and testing

5. **Documentation**
   - [x] Added comprehensive UI design specification to `ai-docs/guides/ui-design-specification.md`
   - [x] Updated progress documentation to track implementation status

### Design Specification Implementation

We're following the UI design specification outlined in `ai-docs/guides/ui-design-specification.md`, which details the approach for each section of the UI:

1. **Dashboard View**: Card-based dashboard with project metrics and activity feed
2. **Projects View**: Data table with sortable/filterable projects and action menus
3. **Task List View**: Sortable task list with status indicators and filters
4. **Task Detail View**: Tabbed interface with task information and activity timeline
5. **Settings View**: Two-panel layout with category navigation and settings forms

All views will share common components such as the collapsible sidebar, breadcrumbs, page headers, and consistent theme support. Implementation will focus on shadcn/ui components as specified in the design document.

### Testing Plan

The implementation is now ready for testing. We need to verify:

1. **Layout and Theme**
   - Test sidebar collapse/expand functionality
   - Verify theme switching between light and dark mode
   - Check responsiveness on different screen sizes

2. **Routing**
   - Verify navigation between different routes
   - Test dynamic routes with parameters (e.g., task detail)
   - Check that breadcrumbs update correctly

3. **Data Management**
   - Test data fetching with mock data
   - Verify that the UI updates when data changes
   - Test error handling and loading states

## Next Steps

1. **Run the application** to test the current implementation:
   ```
   cd app && npm run dev
   ```

2. After verifying the core framework is working, proceed to implementing specific UI components for each view according to the design specification.

3. Update the mock data as needed to provide a more realistic testing environment.

4. Document any issues or adjustments needed based on testing results.
