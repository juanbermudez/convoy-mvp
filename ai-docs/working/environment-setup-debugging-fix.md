## Debugging Resolution

This document outlines the successful resolution of the Electron application startup issues encountered during the UI transition.

### Original Issue

When trying to run the application with `npm run dev`, we encountered the following error:

```
Unable to find Electron app at /Users/juanbermudez/Documents/Work/convoy-mvp/app

Cannot find module '/Users/juanbermudez/Documents/Work/convoy-mvp/app/.vite/build/main.js'. Please verify that the package.json has a valid "main" entry
```

### Solution Applied

The issue was related to a mismatch between the file specified in package.json and the actual file being built by Vite. We made the following key changes:

1. **Fixed package.json main entry**:
   - Changed `"main": ".vite/build/main.js"` to `"main": ".vite/build/index.js"`
   - This matches the actual file name that Vite builds for the main process

2. **Updated forge.config.ts**:
   - Ensured the build configuration correctly specified the entry points
   - Targeted the main process file to the correct location

3. **Ensured renderer configuration**:
   - Updated Vite configuration to properly support Electron's requirements
   - Set the correct base path and output directory

### Validation

We've successfully confirmed that:

1. ✅ The application launches with `npm run dev`
2. ✅ The Vite development server starts correctly (on port 5174)
3. ✅ The main process and preload script are built successfully
4. ✅ Electron loads the main process file without errors

The DevTools console shows a warning about Autofill which is unrelated to our application and can be safely ignored. This is a common warning with Electron applications.

### Key Learning

The most important learning from this debugging session is to ensure alignment between:

1. The output file names generated by the build process (`index.js` in our case)
2. The entry point specified in `package.json` (`main` field)
3. The entry configuration in `forge.config.ts`

When these are misaligned, Electron cannot locate the necessary files to start the application.

## Next Steps

Now that the application launches successfully, we can proceed with:

1. **Manual Testing**:
   - Verify the UI components render as expected
   - Test the sidebar collapse/expand functionality
   - Check theme switching between light and dark modes
   - Test navigation between views

2. **Component Development**:
   - Continue with the Component Framework implementation
   - Implement any remaining components needed
   - Fix any TypeScript errors in the routes files

3. **Documentation**:
   - Update progress documentation to reflect successful environment setup
   - Prepare for Phase 3 of the UI transition plan

### Command to Run the Application

```bash
cd app && npm run dev
