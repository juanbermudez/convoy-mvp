# Sidebar Navigation Enhancement Project Overview

## Memory Bank Context
- Workspace: INIT-001-convoy-development
- Project: Sidebar Navigation Enhancement
- Task: Modify sidebar structure to support knowledge organization

## Project Summary
This project involves restructuring the sidebar navigation in the dashboard to separate active work items from static knowledge and workflow management. The goal is to create a more intuitive navigation structure that reflects the hierarchical knowledge organization of the Convoy system.

## Objectives
- Rename "General" section to "Workbench" for active work items
- Hide unused menu items while preserving them in code
- Create a new "Details" section for static knowledge and documentation
- Create a new "Workflows" section for process management
- Implement placeholder components for new menu items

## Key Technologies
- React for frontend development
- Shadcn UI components
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling

## Constraints & Requirements
- Must maintain the same look and feel as the existing dashboard
- Create empty placeholder components for items without UI
- Preserve hidden menu items in code for future use
- Follow consistent icon usage and styling

## Success Criteria
- Workbench section shows Dashboard, Projects, Tasks, Roadmap, and Activity
- Details section provides access to documentation and knowledge resources
- Workflows section displays workflow categories
- All new menu items have functional routes (even if just placeholders)
- Project runs without errors

## Project Timeline
- Start Date: 04/14/2025
- Target Completion: 04/16/2025
- Key Milestones:
  - Workbench Section Modification: 04/14/2025
  - Details Section Creation: 04/15/2025
  - Workflows Section Creation: 04/15/2025
  - Testing & Validation: 04/16/2025

## Relationship to Convoy Vision
This navigation restructuring enhances the dashboard to better reflect the knowledge structure of the Convoy system. By organizing the sidebar into Workbench, Details, and Workflows sections, users can more intuitively navigate between active work and reference knowledge, supporting the core principles of the Convoy Memory Bank pattern.
