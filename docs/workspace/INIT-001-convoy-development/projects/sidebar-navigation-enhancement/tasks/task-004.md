# Task: Placeholder Component Implementation

## Memory Bank Context
- Workspace: INIT-001-convoy-development
- Project: Sidebar Navigation Enhancement
- Task: Create placeholder component

## Task Description
Create a reusable placeholder component that can be used for all new routes that don't have full implementations yet. This component will display a "Coming Soon" message with the name of the feature.

## Implementation Steps

1. Create a `placeholder.tsx` component that:
   - Accepts a title prop
   - Displays a visually appealing "Coming Soon" message
   - Maintains the same styling as the rest of the dashboard

2. Use this component for all new routes created in Tasks 2 and 3

## Technical Approach
- Use existing UI components and styling
- Make the component flexible for different contexts
- Ensure consistent UI/UX with the rest of the dashboard

## Completion Criteria
- Placeholder component is created
- Component is used consistently across all new routes
- Visual style matches the dashboard design language
