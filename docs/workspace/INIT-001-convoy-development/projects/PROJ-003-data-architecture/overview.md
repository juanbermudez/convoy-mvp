# Data Architecture Implementation Project Overview

## Project Summary
This project involves implementing a comprehensive data architecture for Convoy that aligns with the Linear model, supporting workspaces, projects, workstreams, and tasks. The architecture will use a knowledge graph approach for context retrieval rather than embeddings initially, focusing on explicit relationships between entities to provide consistent and deterministic results for AI agents.

## Objectives
- Design and implement a database schema for workspaces, projects, workstreams, and tasks
- Create a relationship graph structure for efficient context traversal
- Implement Watermelon DB models for local storage
- Develop bidirectional sync between local storage and Supabase
- Create AI context providers for efficient data retrieval
- Document the architecture and query patterns

## Key Technologies
- Supabase for database and authentication
- PostgreSQL for relational database management
- WatermelonDB for local data storage
- Knowledge graph approach for context retrieval
- React for UI components

## Constraints & Requirements
- Must align with Linear's organizational model for familiarity
- Must support both workstream-associated and independent tasks
- Must enable efficient traversal of the relationship graph
- Must allow future expansion to include embeddings for semantic search
- Must optimize for AI context retrieval
- Must support offline-first operations with bidirectional sync

## Success Criteria
- Complete database schema implemented in Supabase
- Knowledge graph relationships properly defined and implemented
- Watermelon DB models created with appropriate relationships
- Bidirectional sync working correctly
- AI context providers returning consistent, relevant data
- Documentation complete and comprehensive

## Task Status Management

| Status | Description | Eligible for AI Processing |
|--------|-------------|---------------------------|
| backlog | Tasks that are planned but not ready yet | No |
| to-do | Tasks ready for implementation | Yes |
| in-progress | Tasks currently being worked on | No |
| completed | Tasks that have been finished | No |

Only tasks explicitly marked as "to-do" will be eligible for AI processing.

## Relationship to Convoy Vision
This project establishes the fundamental data structure that will power the Convoy system. By implementing a knowledge graph-based architecture aligned with familiar models like Linear, we create an intuitive yet powerful foundation for AI-assisted project management. The relationship-focused approach ensures consistent context retrieval for AI agents while maintaining flexibility for future enhancements with semantic search.
