# Supabase Integration Project Overview

## Project Summary
This project involves setting up the foundational database infrastructure for Convoy using Supabase with declarative schemas. The goal is to implement the knowledge graph structure that will power the Memory Bank pattern, providing structured context retrieval for AI agents.

## Objectives
- Create a Supabase project with the complete database schema for Convoy
- Implement all core tables using declarative schema approach
- Create appropriate relationships, constraints, and indexes
- Seed default data including standard workflow definitions
- Integrate with Supabase MCP for context retrieval
- Document the schema and query patterns for AI agents

## Key Technologies
- Supabase for database and authentication
- PostgreSQL for relational database management
- Declarative schema approach for version-controlled database definition
- Supabase MCP for programmatic database access
- JSON/JSONB for flexible structure storage (workflows, tech stack)

## Constraints & Requirements
- Must follow the knowledge graph structure defined in the documentation
- Must support efficient context retrieval for AI agents
- Must implement proper relationships for hierarchical data
- Must be optimized for query performance with appropriate indexes
- Must include proper data types and constraints for data integrity
- Must be easily maintainable and expandable

## Success Criteria
- Complete database schema implemented in Supabase
- All tables have proper relationships and constraints
- Indexes are created for performance optimization
- Standard workflow is seeded in the database
- Context retrieval queries are tested and validated
- Documentation is complete and comprehensive
- Integration with Supabase MCP is functional

## Project Timeline

## Task Status Management

| Status | Description | Eligible for AI Processing |
|--------|-------------|---------------------------|
| backlog | Tasks that are planned but not ready yet | No |
| to-do | Tasks ready for implementation | Yes |
| in-progress | Tasks currently being worked on | No |
| completed | Tasks that have been finished | No |

Only tasks explicitly marked as "to-do" will be eligible for AI processing.

## Relationship to Convoy Vision
This project represents the foundation of the Convoy system. By implementing the knowledge graph in Supabase, we create the data structure that will power the Memory Bank pattern, which is essential for AI context awareness. The database will store all project information, workflows, patterns, and best practices in a way that's optimized for AI consumption, enabling the core functionality of Convoy as an AI orchestration platform.
