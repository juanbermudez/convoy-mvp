# PROJ-002: Offline-First Architecture with WatermelonDB

## Project Summary
This project extends the Convoy data management capabilities by implementing an offline-first architecture using WatermelonDB, enabling local-first data access with seamless synchronization to Supabase. This approach improves user experience by providing uninterrupted access to project data even without an internet connection, similar to modern tools like Linear.

## Objectives
- Implement WatermelonDB as the local database for Convoy
- Create a bidirectional sync mechanism between WatermelonDB and Supabase
- Adapt the Context Service to prioritize local data access
- Handle offline operations and synchronization
- Implement conflict resolution strategies
- Ensure schema consistency between local and remote databases

## Key Technologies
- WatermelonDB for local database management
- Supabase for remote data storage and authentication
- React Hooks for managing local data access
- Synchronization algorithms for efficient data transfer
- Offline queue management for pending operations

## Constraints & Requirements
- Must be compatible with the existing Supabase integration
- Must maintain data integrity across sync operations
- Must handle network interruptions gracefully
- Must provide feedback on sync status to users
- Must optimize sync operations to minimize bandwidth usage
- Must handle schema migrations in both databases

## Success Criteria
- Users can access and modify data when offline
- Changes sync automatically when connectivity is restored
- Local-first data access is significantly faster than direct Supabase queries
- Conflicts are detected and resolved according to defined strategies
- Data remains consistent across devices after sync operations
- User experience is seamless regardless of connectivity status

## Relationship to Convoy Vision
This project strengthens Convoy's position as a modern development platform by implementing a resilient, offline-capable architecture. The offline-first approach aligns with Convoy's goal of providing AI orchestration that works reliably in varied environments. By enabling local data access with efficient synchronization, we ensure that the Memory Bank pattern functions effectively regardless of connectivity, enhancing the overall user experience and platform reliability.
