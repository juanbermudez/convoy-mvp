# Task 005: Testing and Documentation

## Task Description
Perform comprehensive testing of the offline-first architecture in various connectivity scenarios and create detailed documentation on the implementation, usage patterns, and best practices for developers working with the system.

## Implementation Details
We'll create a robust test suite covering various scenarios, document the architecture and implementation details, and provide guidelines for developers working with the offline-first system.

## Sub-Tasks
