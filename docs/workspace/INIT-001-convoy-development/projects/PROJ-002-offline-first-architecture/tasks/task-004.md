# Task 004: Advanced Sync Features

## Task Description
Enhance the synchronization engine with advanced features including sophisticated conflict resolution, reliable offline operation queue, sync recovery mechanisms, and multi-device synchronization support.

## Implementation Details
We'll extend the basic sync engine with more robust conflict resolution strategies, implement a reliable queue for offline operations, add recovery mechanisms for sync failures, and ensure consistent behavior across multiple devices.
