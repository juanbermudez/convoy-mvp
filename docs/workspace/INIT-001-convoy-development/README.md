# Offline-First Data Integration Plan

## Overview

This directory contains the detailed implementation plan for integrating our Convoy MVP dashboard with Supabase and WatermelonDB to enable offline-first functionality. This integration will allow users to view and interact with real project and task data regardless of connectivity status.

## Documents

This implementation plan consists of the following documents:

1. **[Offline-First Data Integration](./offline-first-data-integration.md)** - The main implementation plan detailing the architecture, components, and implementation steps.

2. **[Offline-First Schema Updates](./offline-first-schema-updates.md)** - The database schema changes required to support offline-first functionality.

3. **[Component Migration Examples](./component-migration-examples.md)** - Examples of how to update existing components to use the new data layer.

## Key Features

- **Offline-First Operation**: Continue working with data even when offline
- **Automatic Synchronization**: Changes sync automatically when connectivity is restored
- **Real-Time Updates**: UI updates in real-time when data changes
- **Conflict Resolution**: Robust handling of concurrent edits
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient data access for large datasets

## Implementation Approach

The implementation follows these key principles:

1. **Layered Architecture**: Clear separation between UI, data access, and synchronization
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Add offline capabilities without disrupting existing functionality
3. **Optimistic UI**: Update the UI immediately, with background synchronization
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Provide functionality with reduced capabilities when offline
5. **Transparent Feedback**: Keep users informed about connectivity and sync status

## Getting Started

To implement this plan:

1. Start with the schema updates in [Offline-First Schema Updates](./offline-first-schema-updates.md)
2. Implement the data layer as described in [Offline-First Data Integration](./offline-first-data-integration.md)
3. Update components following the examples in [Component Migration Examples](./component-migration-examples.md)

## Dependencies

This implementation depends on:

- **WatermelonDB**: For local data storage and synchronization
- **Supabase**: For backend database and real-time updates
- **React Context**: For state management
- **shadcn/ui**: For UI components

## Timeline

The implementation is expected to take approximately 2 weeks:

- Week 1: Schema updates, data layer implementation
- Week 2: Component updates, testing, and refinement

## Next Steps

After this implementation:

1. Add authentication integration
2. Implement additional performance optimizations
3. Add advanced filtering and searching capabilities
4. Enhance analytics and telemetry

This implementation plan is part of the Convoy MVP project, which aims to create an AI orchestration platform with structured workflows and knowledge graphs.
