# AI Agent Rules

This section contains the rules and documentation that govern AI agent behavior in the Convoy system. These files serve different but complementary purposes:

## Rule Files vs. Guidelines

### 1. Rule Files - Direct AI Instructions
These are the actual rules that are loaded into the AI agent:

- **[Rule File](rule-file.md)**: The primary instructions fed directly to AI agents that implement the Memory Bank pattern and Convoy workflow.

- **[Implementation Details](implementation.md)**: Technical details for integrating the rules with various AI agent systems.

### 2. Guidelines - Human-Readable Documentation
This is detailed documentation that explains how the rules work in practice:

- **[Workflow Guidelines](guidelines.md)**: Detailed templates, examples, and best practices for how AI agents operate within the system. This serves as a reference for humans to understand exactly how AI agents format responses, handle checkpoints, and structure their work.

## How These Files Work Together

Think of this relationship like:
- The rule file is the "code" that runs in the AI system
- The guidelines are the comprehensive "user manual" that explains what that code does

While AI agents follow the instructions in the rule files, humans can refer to the guidelines to understand what to expect from the AI agent at each stage of the workflow, including specific templates it will use, the format of its output, and the patterns it will follow.
